# ED X52 MFD Controller #

This small application parses the Elite: Dangerous log files for pertinent information, and then displays this information on the Multi-Function Display screen of the Saitek X52. 

If you haven't already, you'll need to add the line
`VerboseLogging="1"` 
to your AppConfig.xml file. 

## Installation Instructions ##
 1. Put the binary into the same directory as the `DirectOutput.dll` file that came with your Saitek software.
 2. Execute the binary.
 3. Play the game.
 4. Be amazed!
